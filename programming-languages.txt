C++ (pronounced as cee plus plus, /?si?/ /pl?s/ /pl?s/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

Java is a functional computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[11] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[12] meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.[13] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

JavaScript (/?d???v??skr?pt/; JS) is a dynamic computer programming language.[5] It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.[5] It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.[17][18][19] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.[20][21] The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.[22]

C (/?si?/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
